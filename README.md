All of the python codes that I have been learning till now.
Includes all the beginner to intermediate programs. 

I have been learning python with my friend https://github.com/hemkeshkantawala11 since we were 14.
The most interesting projects of all that I have been working on is the monopoly game.More info here-https://github.com/devanujpatel/Python-Monopoly At every point in the development of the wonderful game I learnt many new things and wish to continue learning and never ever stop!

## tic-tac-toe
It is a game which we all once played in school on the back of our notebooks. have created only the non-GUI version of the game.
