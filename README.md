All of the python codes that I have been learning till now.
Includes all the beginner to intermediate programs. 

I have been learning python with my friend @hemkeshkantawala11 since we were 14 and have a basic knowledge of python.
The most interesting projects of all that I have been working on is the monopoly game.More info here-https://github.com/devanujpatel/Python-Monopoly At every point in the development of the wonderful gameI learnt many new things and wish to continue learning and never ever stop!
